# Special Positions in a Binary Matrix
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the number of special positions in mat.

A position (i, j) is called special if mat[i][j] == 1 and all other elements in row i and column j are 0 (rows and columns are 0-indexed).

 

## Example 1:

<img width="220" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0e33da-f3ed-4793-989f-b76188f2b969" />

Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]

Output: 1

Explanation: (1, 2) is a special position because mat[1][2] == 1 and all other elements in row 1 and column 2 are 0.

## Example 2:

<img width="214" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab68bffe-41f9-4ace-a980-72c2619bac6a" />

Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]

Output: 3

Explanation: (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 2) are special positions.
 

## Constraints:

m == mat.length

n == mat[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 100

mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
